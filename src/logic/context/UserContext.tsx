    biography: `I was born on December 14, 1992, in Istanbul, Turkey. My interest in technology and websites started early, and over time, I explored various engineering fields, particularly in automation, robotics, and electronics. I pursued a degree in Mechanical Engineering at Middle East Technical University, where coding became an essential tool in solving complex engineering problems. This early exposure cemented my passion for software development.

After graduation, I worked for six years at TurkishAerospace as a Manufacturing Engineer, contributing to various aircraft projects and refining my technical and problem-solving skills. However, my growing interest in software development led me to enroll in a condensed software development course offered by my university. During the pandemic, I made the most of the situation to shift my career direction towards becoming a developer.

Initially focusing on Flutter, I soon realized that Frontend Development offered broader opportunities. I joined Jagaad Academyâ€™s six-month Frontend course and graduated with top honors. Following this, I spent a full year at Jagaad as a Junior Frontend Developer and Assistant Tutor, where I mentored aspiring developers.

Currently, I have been working as a Frontend Developer at Datazone for half a year. Datazone is a rapidly growing Data Manipulation Platform startup, serving three enterprise customers even before its public launch. We are on the verge of a public launch, and I'm excited to be part of a team that is shaping the future of data solutions.`,
